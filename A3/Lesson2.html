	<p> "Let's start by answering the question: 'What can a good mentor do for me?'. 
	The study "Career Benefits Associated with Mentoring Protege: A Meta Analysis" from the 
	Journal of Applied Psychology found that people who are mentored and sponsored 
	report having more career success, such as higher compensation, a greater number 
	of promotions, more job satisfaction and a higher level of career commitment. 
	Sheryl Sandberg references this study as she explains the benefits of mentoring, 
	"Both men and women with sponsors are more likely to ask for stretch assignments 
	and pay raises than their peers of the same gender without sponsors." In my 
	opinion, mentors are crucial in helping individuals connect the dots between 
	their abilities and their potential, their goals and their successes. They 
	provide the advice, confidence, and the network that allows individuals find
	their avenue of success." (<a href="http://www.bestkeptself.com/importance-mentor/"> www.bestkeptself.com</a>)</p>
